Feeds URL Fetcher
======================

A Feeds plugin that will fetch files from an any URL supported by PHP.
This is a port to Backdrop CMS

It is not yet complete as I have not worked out if it is possible to get the config URL to appear in the import form.

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
